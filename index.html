                    We know we must prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. California employers must establish
                    policies prohibiting harassment. And employers with five or more employees are required by law to
                    train all employees and supervisors on harassment prevention.

                    Despite our collective knowledge about the right thing to do, the problem has not gone away. There
                    has been an increase in reported harassment-related incidents while many employees work remotely.

                    In 2020, employers paid out more than $65 million in sex-based harassment federal enforcement
                    actions, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) — the second most in the
                    last decade. And this figure doesn't include money paid resulting from litigation.

                    Ultimately, working from home invites coworkers into what was formerly an employee's private domain,
                    which can create fertile ground for harassment and unwelcome behavior that may never have happened
                    in the physical workplace.

                            Technology's proliferation has opened additional avenues of interaction.<br /><br />

                            Texts, emails, or posts on social media sites can cause problems in your workplace.
                            Employees who may be interacting after hours on social media may be sharing personal
                            information and making comments online that they might never feel comfortable saying
                            face-to-face.<br /><br />

                            And the proliferation of videoconferencing plays a role as well. Working from home and
                            experiencing harassment in a joking manner during a Zoom meeting, for instance, may make it
                            more difficult for some individuals to address and report the harassment.<br /><br />

                            A worker who experiences unwelcome comments, such as those based on race, national origin,
                            age, or disability, for example, from a coworker will no longer feel comfortable with their
                            work environment.<br /><br />

                            Treat it just as you would any other harassment complaint. Train your workers to understand
                            that online harassment of a coworker, whether during or after hours, violates company
                            policy.

                            harassment— including some you might think are innocuous. While not all stares are sexual
                            harassment, some are. There's a difference between a non-sexual stare from someone who's
                            lost in thought versus blatant leering, in which someone looks a person up and down, or
                            other lascivious expressions.<br /><br />

                            There is no mechanical formula to identify a hostile work environment. Look at each
                            situation on a case-by-case basis.

                            volunteers, and people "providing services pursuant to a contract," such as independent
                            contractors.<br /><br />

                            The alleged harasser doesn't have to be an employee. If a vendor or customer continuously
                            enters your workplace and harasses employees, you must deal with that situation, too. You
                            can be held liable if the employer, its agents or supervisors know or should have known of
                            the harassment and fail to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.<br /><br />

                            Make sure your employees know these rules.

                            relationship is between a supervisor and a subordinate given the power dynamic involved.
                            Workplace romances can cause a number of problems.<br /><br />

                            Employers may be held liable for their supervisors' actions, regardless of whether they knew
                            about the behavior, and policies against such behavior will not insulate employers from the
                            liability.<br /><br />

                            Because employers have a duty to prevent harassment in the workplace, managers will want to
                            pay attention to any workplace romance due to legal risks and address conflicts of interest.

                            immediate supervisor. Employers must provide an alternative complaint mechanism and instruct
                            supervisors to report all complaints of misconduct.

                            information on the complaint and investigation only on a need-to-know basis. Also stress
                            your anti-retaliation policy to all parties and witnesses in the investigation.
